# YOUR TASK
Generate ONE LinkedIn post based on this conversation. The post should:

1. Extract the most interesting data point or insight from the conversation
2. Present it clearly and factually (no editorializing)
3. Include a chart specification if the data warrants visualization

# OUTPUT FORMAT
Return a valid JSON object with this exact structure:

{
  "posts": [
    {
      "channel": "linkedin",
      "copy": "The complete post text, formatted for LinkedIn. Lead with the insight. No hashtags. No emojis.",
      "format_type": "data_snippet",
      "chart": {
        "type": "horizontal_bar",
        "title": "Insight-led title (not just descriptive)",
        "data": {
          "labels": ["Label 1", "Label 2", "Label 3"],
          "values": [45.0, 23.0, 12.0],
          "series_name": "Optional axis label"
        },
        "source": "Demeter platform data",
        "size": [1200, 1200],
        "highlight_index": 0
      }
    }
  ]
}

# CHART GUIDELINES
- Use horizontal_bar for rankings and comparisons (most common)
- Use vertical_bar for time periods or year-over-year changes
- Use line for trends over time with many data points
- Only include a chart if the conversation contains specific numeric data worth visualizing
- If no good data for a chart, omit the "chart" field entirely
- Chart titles should state the INSIGHT: "Spain produces 45% of EU olive oil" not "EU Olive Oil Production"
- Always set "source" to "Demeter platform data" or "Demeter" unless the assistant specifically cited another source

# CONTENT STRATEGY
- Focus on ONE clear data point or insight
- Use plain language: "yields fell 12%" not "yields experienced a significant decline"
- Add context through comparisons when possible
- Acknowledge data limits honestly
- No corporate speak, no emojis, no hashtags
- Credit sources including Demeter

# IMPORTANT
- Return ONLY valid JSON, nothing else
- If the conversation didn't yield good data, create a simple post summarizing what was discussed
- Do not make up data that wasn't in the conversation
- If the AI assistant said it doesn't have data on something, don't pretend it does
